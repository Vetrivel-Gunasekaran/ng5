      <strong><sup>†</sup>Section 2: BMO Blue Chip GIC </strong>

      BMO Blue Chip GICs are issued by Bank of Montreal Mortgage Corporation and guaranteed by Bank of Montreal. The
      principal amount of a BMO Blue Chip GIC is guaranteed and is repayable upon maturity, but there is no guarantee of
      earning any return linked to the performance of the underlying securities. The rate of return for the term
      payable, if any, will be the return on the Reference Portfolio but will not be less than zero or more than the
      Maximum Rate of Return for the Term. The return on the Reference Portfolio, if any, is determined without
      reference to any dividends or distributions paid on the securities and is the simple average of the percentage
      changes in the value of each underlying security in the Reference Portfolio over the term of the GIC. The rate of
      return for the term is not an annual rate but is the rate of return over the entire term of the GIC. If market
      disruptions or other special circumstances affect the calculation of the return, the calculation agent may adjust
      or delay the calculation or payment of interest, estimate the value of an underlying security, replace a security
      and/or determine the amount of interest, if any, that may be payable in an alternate manner. The Terms and
      Conditions for BMO Blue Chip GICs are available at your local BMO Bank of Montreal branch or online at
      bmo.com/progressivegic.
