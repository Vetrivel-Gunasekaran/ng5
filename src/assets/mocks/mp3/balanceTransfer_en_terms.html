        <b>
          *By submitting a request for a balance transfer, you’re agreeing to
          the terms and conditions in this offer. We provide important
          information about this promotional balance transfer offer here, and
          don’t forget your Cardholder Agreement also contains important terms
          about promotional balance transfers:
        </b>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Balance Transfer</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you make a credit card balance transfer, you’re moving an
          outstanding balance from a non-BMO credit card to your BMO credit
          card. You could consolidate your debt and save on interest payments if
          you transfer a balance from other credit cards that charge higher
          interest to your BMO credit card with this promotional interest rate!
        </li>
        <li>
          Balance transfers are treated as cash advances and the promotional
          interest rate applies from the date the transfer amounts are posted to
          your BMO credit card account (the “Account”). Any balance transfer
          requests received and posted to your Account after ##RELEVANT_DATE##,
          will not be eligible for this offer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Balance transfers cannot be used to make a payment on any other BMO
          credit card account or any other BMO lending account or for
          pre-authorized payments.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Promotional Interest Rate</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each balance transfer amount is eligible for the promotional interest
          rate of ##RATE##% until the promotional rate expiry date, provided
          that each balance transfer is posted to your Account by
          ##RELEVANT_DATE##, and your Account remains in good standing. The
          promotional interest rate expiry date is calculated based on the first
          balance transfer transaction date within the offer period and any
          subsequent balance transfer transaction that was accepted within the
          same offer period will have the same expiry date. After the
          promotional interest rate expires, the standard rate goes into effect
          after the following statement cycle date.
        </li>
        <li>
          This offer may be changed or withdrawn without notice and is only
          valid for the Account referenced in the attached offer and is not
          transferable.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you do not make your minimum payment by the payment due date and
          have not paid it by the date we prepare your next statement two times
          in any 12-month period, you will lose your promotional interest rate
          and it will increase to the default rate disclosed on the card carrier
          or any other terms or notices we provide to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          After the promotional rate expires, any remaining balance transfer
          amounts will be charged interest at the standard annual interest rate
          for cash advances, starting from the first day of the following
          statement period. The promotional interest rate of ##RATE##% does not
          apply to purchases, fees, cash advances and other charges posted to
          your Account during the promotional period. Please refer to your
          monthly statement for the interest rate(s) applicable to your Account.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your Account has balances with different interest rates, such as
          purchases with a standard interest rate and balance transfers with a
          promotional interest rate, any payment that exceeds the minimum
          payment will be allocated proportionately to those balances according
          to the terms set out in the BMO Credit Card Cardholder Agreement. For
          example, if you have a balance of $800 in purchases at the standard
          interest rate and a $200 balance transfer balance at a promotional
          interest rate, 80 percent of your payment will be allocated to your
          purchases balance and 20 percent will be allocated to your balance
          transfer amount balance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Balance Transfer Fee</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each balance transfer is subject to a fee of ##RESERVED_7##% which
          will be charged to your Account on the date the balance transfer is
          posted to your Account. For example, if an amount of $1,000 is
          transferred to your Account, you will be charged a fee of
          $##RESERVED_4##.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may request a balance transfer for as low as $100, as long as the
          transfer amount plus the fee does not exceed the unused portion of the
          credit limit on your Account at the time of processing. Balance
          transfers are only available for balances in Canadian dollars.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Payments</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You will pay interest on purchases unless you pay your full Account
          balance by the payment due date. For example, if you complete a
          balance transfer for $5,000 and spend $2,000 in purchases during the
          same statement period, you must pay the entire balance of $7,000
          before the payment due date to avoid paying interest on your
          purchases. You will be charged interest if you only pay the amount
          owing for your purchases. There is no interest-free grace period for
          cash advances or balance transfers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>

      <p>
        <b>Rewards</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Balance transfers do not qualify to earn loyalty rewards such as AIR
          MILES<sup>®†</sup> Reward Miles, BMO CashBack<sup>®</sup> rewards or
          BMO Rewards<sup>®</sup> points.
        </li>
